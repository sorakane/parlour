/**
 * The room vocabulary, and nothing else.
 *
 * This is a leaf module on purpose. Seat ranges, join routes, and the game
 * packs themselves are all keyed on `MultiplayerGameId` through total
 * `Record`s, and every one of those tables would otherwise have to import the
 * module that owns the packs — which imports the authority, which imports the
 * seat ranges. Keeping the id list here means each table depends on the
 * vocabulary rather than on the other tables.
 *
 * Saved match history is keyed on these ids. They are stable forever.
