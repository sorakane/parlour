/**
 * Everything one game's create screen does differently, and nothing it does the

 *
 * There used to be fourteen create pages. They were 84% identical — the session
 * ref, the open-on-mount effect, the error branch, the seat mapping, the lobby,
 * the leave link — and what genuinely varied was this: a route back, a glyph,
 * two strings, and how the game turns its setup store into room settings. Every
 * one of those fourteen files also carried its copy in English only, because
 * copy repeated fourteen times is copy the catalogues never reached.
 *
 * So this is the whole per-game surface now, and it is a total `Record`: adding
 * a game to {@link MULTIPLAYER_GAME_IDS} without describing its create screen is
 * a compile error, and describing one is all a new game has to do. There is no
 * page to write — `app/[game]/create/page.tsx` builds the route from this table.
