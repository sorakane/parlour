/**
 * The one place a game becomes a *room*.
 *
 * Before this file, adding a game to friend rooms meant editing five separate
 * chains keyed on `settings.gameId`: a def lookup, a settings resolver, a
 * runtime builder, a seat range, and a join route. Several of them ended in a
 * fallback — `return createBlitzDef()` — so a game added to some and forgotten
 * in the others did not fail. It quietly played Blitz's rules in a Spades room.
 *
 * `tableRoute.ts` already fixed its own copy of that bug by becoming a total
 * `Record`, and left a comment saying so. This is that same lesson applied to
 * the rest of it: omit a game and the `Record<MultiplayerGameId, RoomGamePack>`
 * below is a compile error. There is no fallback left to be wrong about.
 *
 * Each entry is written through {@link definePack}, which is generic over the
 * pack's own `(State, Config)`. That keeps every cast next to the concrete
 * types it is about, and lets the registry expose an erased surface the room
 * layer consumes without knowing which game it holds.
