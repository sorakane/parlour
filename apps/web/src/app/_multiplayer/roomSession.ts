 * layers.
 *
 * Known gap, stated because it is the honest one: `D2c — a seat drops and
 * returns during the grace period` is still flaky in the browser suite. The
 * failure is the returning page not finding the room, which the non-veiled
 * rejoin scenarios share, so it reads as harness rather than protocol — but it
 * is not proven, and a drop-and-return is a normal thing for a friend game to
 * do. If a returning seat misbehaves in the wild, this line is the switch.
 *
